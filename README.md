## COP-3330C-24217 Object-Oriented Programming Spring 2025 @ Valencia College
Programming Project 3 Part 2

This repository contains the final version of Programming Project 3 - Part 2. This project attempted to verify proper formatting for a username and password entered by the user. The learning outcomes for this assignment were centered around Exception handling and creating custom Exceptions. The constructor for the Class containing the username and password included validation statements. If validation failed, the constructor threw a custom exception with a custom error message based on which validation statement failed. The main() method contained a try-catch block to catch those custom exceptions and display the custom message provided by the exception generated. Additional information is included in the header of each file located in the .src folder. 

**-P.S.: Thanks for the demo videos for each topic covered in this class Professor.  They were well explained and very helpful.**
